// The AI chat assistant. One message in, one reply out.
//
// It answers ONLY from our own data:
//   - forum questions and their answers (everyone's)
//   - the PDFs of the user who is asking (never another user's)
//
// Steps for one message:
//   1. Small talk (hi, thanks, who are you...) gets a fixed reply. No AI call.
//   2. Turn the message into a vector (Gemini embedding, RETRIEVAL_QUERY).
//   3. Read the ready vectors from MySQL: every question, and the PDF chunks
//      of THIS user only. Score each one with cosine similarity in Node.
//   4. Keep the scores above the threshold, best first, at most MAX_SOURCES.
//      Only when NOTHING is close enough: look for the message's keywords in
//      every question and answer (plain SQL LIKE, no vectors). This is the
//      safety net for words that only appear in an answer.
//   5. Nothing close enough -> say "I do not know". No Gemini text call.
//   6. Read the real text from MySQL: each matched question with ALL of its
//      answers, and each matched PDF chunk. Answers are never searched.
//   7. Ask Gemini to answer using only these numbered sources.
//   8. Show only the sources the answer really cites as [n].
//
// The reply has a "kind":
//   chat     -> small talk, with suggested next questions
//   answer   -> answered, with sources
//   related  -> not answered, but these threads are close
//   notfound -> nothing in our data. The UI offers "Ask the community".
