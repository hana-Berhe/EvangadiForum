// name:        the tag saved on a question and used in ?tag= filters
// description: short text for people (returned by GET /api/tags)
// examples:    longer list of topics, only used to match questions to tags.
//              Longer text gives a much better match than a few words: with
//              only the short description, one or two tags win almost every
//              question.
